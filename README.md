# DB-Final-Project — Jamya

## Introduction
Jamya is an application that I built as a final project for my Database Systems course. The backend has been created in C#, ASP.NET, and some Javascript. Meanwhile, the frontend has been created using Materialize CSS and jQuery.

## Conclusion
Our group scored full marks for the project. The basic requirements were fulfilled i.e. CRUD as well as some additional cherries on top.
